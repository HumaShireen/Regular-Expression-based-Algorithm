# Regular-Expression-based-Algorithm

## Purpose
This code aims to leverage genome-wide transcriptional regulatory circuits to predict tissue-specific enhancers. It aligns human and mouse orthologous sequences for functionally verified enhancers and identifies conserved consensus transcription factor binding site sequences between human and mouse genomes.

## Operating System
The code is designed to run on BioLinux.

## Programming Language
Perl (version 5.32.1) is used for implementation.

## How to Run the Code
1. Open the Linux terminal.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HumaShireen/Regular-Expression-based-Algorithm.git
   ```
Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of this repository.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
4. Execute the following command to run the code:
```
perl src/codename.pl
```
5. Press enter to run the code.

## Input Files
- Transcription factor codes from TRANSFAC.
- Sequences of human enhancers.
- Sequences of mouse orthologous sequences.
